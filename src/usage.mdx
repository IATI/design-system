<Title>Using the IATI Design System</Title>

After completing the <a href="../?path=/docs/installation--docs">installation</a> instructions,
core styles, such as typography, should be applied to your site.

This Storybook shows the components available in the design system.
For each component, the **Docs** page shows available variants of the component, like the example shown below for the default variant of the Button component.

Click on **Show code** in the bottom right to see the HTML elements and classes being used and apply them to your own site.
