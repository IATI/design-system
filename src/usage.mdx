<Title>Using the IATI Design System</Title>

The IATI Design System is intended to increase the visual consistency of the IATI web estate and make it easier for people to navigate unfamiliar tools by providing consistent locations and hints as to where functionality can be found.

It is continuously being updated. If, when updating a website to use the design system, you find that an important question is unanswered, open a GitHub issue to discuss. In the meantime, continue to use your best judgement for the task at hand.

## Enable the Design System

After completing the <a href="../?path=/docs/installation--docs">installation</a> instructions,
you must enable the design system styles, by applying the `.iati-design-system--enabled` class on the `<body>` element of your page.
This will apply core styles, such as typography, to the site, and enable you to use components from the design system.

```html
<body class="iati-design-system--enabled">
  <!-- The rest of your page content -->
</body>
```

## Using Components

This Storybook site shows all the components available in the design system.
For each component, the **"Docs"** page shows available variants of the component.

Click on **Show code** in the bottom right to see a HTML snippet which shows which CSS classes to use.
For example, the snippet for the example below shows us that the `.iati-button` class has been applied to a `<button>` element.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Default} />

## Incremental Migration

For larger projects migrating to the IATI Design System, it can be useful to roll-out the styles incrementally instead of globally, to avoid clashes with existing styles.

To support this this, instead of appling the `.iati-design-system--enabled` class to the `<body>` element,
it is possible to wrap any section of the page in a container with the `.iati-design-system--enabled` class,
so that the IATI Design System styles are only applied to that section.
This can be used on large components like the Header or for smaller elements like a Button.

### Example

The following code shows how to apply the IATI Design System to the header and footer,
leaving the rest of the page as-is:

For a working example, see the <a href="/?path=/story/layout-page--incremental-migration">Incremental Migration story</a>.

```html
<body>
  <div class="iati-design-system--enabled">
    <header class="iati-header">
      <!-- IATI Design System header code -->
    </header>
  </div>

  <!-- The rest of your page content -->

  <div class="iati-design-system--enabled">
    <footer class="iati-footer">
      <!-- IATI Design System footer code -->
    </footer>
  </div>
</body>
```
