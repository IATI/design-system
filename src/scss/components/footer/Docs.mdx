<Title />

The footer of an IATI website may contain 1-3 sections, depending on what's needed for the application. Each section is optional, except the legal section. The order shown here must be respected.

The colours, fonts, images and other styles are an inherent part of the design and must be used when this design is used.

The footer designs are responsive for reduced widths. Beyond the maximum width shown here the footer should be extended to the full width of the page by continuation of the solid background and lines.

### Useful Links Section

Useful links might include a mini sitemap, related resources or signposts to alternative/complimentary tools. The Newsletter signup should only be included if particularly relevant to a particular tool; if omitted the second column may be used for more links per the "Additional Information" design.

### Additional Information Section

Additional Information should include details of licensing, software versions, and short statements about the software, if relevant.

<Canvas of={ComponentStories.AdditionalInformationSection} />

### Legal Section

The links must be included and link to the URLs provided here. If the application supports multiple languages then the links should go to the translated versions of the web terms as appropriate. The language switcher and social media links must be included.
