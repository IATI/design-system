<Title>Brand Background</Title>

**This component expects the background image to be served by the app using the design system.**

To use this component, take the following steps:

1. Go to <a href="../?path=/docs/brand-logos--docs#marque-white">Marque White</a> and download the image.

2. Serve the file from your app. This will depend on the technology your app is written in.

3. Optionally, use the provided CSS custom property to configure the path to the image. The default is `/images/marque-white.svg`.

   ```css
   .iati-brand-background {
     --background-image: url("PATH_TO_IMAGE");
   }
   ```

4. Apply the appropriate classes to your html elements, using the example below.

<Stories />
