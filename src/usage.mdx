<Title>Using the IATI Design System</Title>

The IATI Design System is intended to increase the visual consistency of the IATI web estate and make it easier for people to navigate unfamiliar tools by providing consistent locations and hints as to where functionality can be found.

It is continuously being updated. If, when updating a website to use the design system, you find that an important question is unanswered, open a GitHub issue to discuss. In the meantime, continue to use your best judgement for the task at hand.

After completing the <a href="../?path=/docs/installation--docs">installation</a> instructions, core styles, such as typography, should be applied to your site.

This Storybook shows the components available in the design system.
For each component, the **Docs** page shows available variants of the component, like the example shown below for the default variant of the Button component.

Click on **Show code** in the bottom right to see the HTML elements and classes being used and apply them to your own site.
