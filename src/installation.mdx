<Title>Installing the IATI Design System</Title>

## CDN (Recommended)

The recommended installation method is including the CSS and Javascript files which we are distirbuted using the [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) CDN.

Add the following code inside the `<head>` of your HTML pages, replacing `<VERSION>` with the version you want to use, e.g. `1.2.3`.
This project is versioned using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), and the latest version is shown on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/IATI/design-system/releases).
You can [watch the Github repository](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository) to be notified when a new version is released.

```html
<link
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/iati-design-system@<VERSION>/dist/css/iati.min.css"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/iati-design-system@<VERSION>/dist/js/iati.js"></script>
```

## NPM (Optional)

It is also possible to include the design system in a [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) project.

First install with npm:

```code
npm install iati-design-system
```

Then import the package in your `.scss` file. The [Node.js Package Importer](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use/#node-js-package-importer) is required to use this syntax.

```css
@use "pkg:iati-design-system";
```
